## Coding Experience
I have been into coding since about the third grade. I see it as a powerful skill to help create anything and everything that I could ever want/need. 

## Goals
Being a Videogame Dev has been my goal since I first discovered coding. Having the power to create a whole universe that could either tell a magnificent story or just give people a good time is a superpower.

## Background
Growing up for the first 5 or 6 years of my life I was an only child. Then my mother married a man and I got an older brother, then she had two more kids, so I went from an only child to being the youngest, to the middle child. I love my siblings and I love my family, they have been there for me since day 1 and I intend on repaying the favor.
