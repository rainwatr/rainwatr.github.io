## Coding Experience
I have been into coding since about the third grade. I see it as a powerful skill to help create anything and everything that I could ever want/need. 

## Goals
Being a Videogame Dev has been my goal since I first discovered coding. Having the power to create a whole universe that could either tell a magnificent story or just give people a good time is a superpower.
